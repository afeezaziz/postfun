    <h1>About Postfun</h1>
    <p>Postfun is an experimental retro-styled trading playground. The Flask + Jinja app mirrors the original React PRD with server-rendered pages, a Nostr-based login, and a simple token model.</p>

    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This demo shows how to deliver a fast, no-JS-framework experience: forms are CSRF-protected, pages are cached by the browser, and components are minimal. The Pool page includes a lightweight inline SVG chart and mock holders/swaps data.</p>
