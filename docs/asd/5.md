# the `postfun` economic engine

## design philosophy

the postfun economic model is built on three core principles:
1. create accelerating scarcity
2. align incentives between all participants
3. ensure platform sustainability

## the full token journey

1. **birth**: a pool is created with 1,000,000,000 tokens held in the `asset` reserve
2. **distribution**: as users buy tokens, the `token_reserve` decreases
3. **level 2 burn (the culling)**: at 1m sats in the real `bitcoin_reserve`, a fixed **50,000,000 tokens** are burned
4. **level 3 burn (the inferno)**: at 10m sats, a fixed **100,000,000 tokens** are burned
5. **graduation burn (the supernova)**: at 100m sats, a final **150,000,000 tokens** are burned
6. **the dex listing**: after the final burn, 100% of the remaining, user-held tokens are paired with 45% of the `bitcoin_reserve`

## the flow of a sat (fee breakdown)

when a user makes a 10,000 sat 'buy' swap at level 1 (10% fee):

- total debit: 10,000 sats
- fee (10%): 1,000 sats
- sats entering the `bitcoin_reserve` for the swap: 9,000 sats
- **fee distribution (of the 1,000 sats)**:
  - platform treasury: 800 sats (80%)
  - content creator wallet: 150 sats (15%)
  - minter wallet: 50 sats (5%)

this happens on *every single swap*, creating a constant flow of micro-rewards.
