# how to mint a post

## becoming a minter

the first person to mint a post becomes the "minter." as a minter, you get a special share of fees and a massive bonus if the pool graduates. this role is one of the most crucial and potentially rewarding in the entire postfun ecosystem, as it requires both cultural awareness and financial risk-taking to identify content with long-term potential.

minters serve as the bridge between raw social media content and the financial markets that postfun creates. they're essentially early adopters who recognize the potential value in specific tweets or posts before the broader market does. this requires a unique combination of skills including trend analysis, understanding of social dynamics, and willingness to take calculated financial risks.

the minter's reward structure is designed to incentivize careful selection of content while rewarding those who successfully identify viral potential. in addition to the ongoing fee share (5% of all trading fees in the pool), minters are eligible for a substantial graduation bonus if their content pool reaches the highest level of success. this bonus can be life-changing, making minter selection a high-stakes activity where the potential rewards justify the risks.

becoming a successful minter requires developing an intuition for what makes content valuable in the postfun marketplace. viral tweets often share certain characteristics: they tap into current cultural trends, generate strong emotional responses, come from influential creators, or make predictions that later prove accurate. the most successful minters learn to recognize these patterns quickly and act decisively.

## minting process

the process of minting a post on postfun is designed to be straightforward while ensuring that only serious participants create new markets. here's a detailed breakdown of each step:

1. find a tweet on x.com you believe in. copy its url
   this first step is where all the skill and intuition comes into play. successful minters spend considerable time monitoring social media for emerging trends, controversial statements, or predictions that might gain traction. the best opportunities often come from tweets that haven't yet gone viral but show signs of potential. look for content that generates strong reactions, comes from accounts with growing followings, or touches on topics that are gaining attention in broader culture.

2. go to `postfun.xyz`
   navigate to the main postfun website. the platform is designed to be accessible from any modern web browser, though the chrome extension provides enhanced functionality. make sure you're on the official site to avoid phishing attempts or fake platforms.

3. paste the url into the "mint a new pool" box on the home page
   the homepage features a prominent input box specifically for minting new content pools. paste your copied tweet url here. the system will automatically verify that the tweet is valid and doesn't already have a postfun market. if the tweet is eligible, you'll proceed to the next step. if not, you'll receive an error message explaining why.

4. you'll be taken to the new pool page. a transaction will be prompted to pay the 1,000 sat minting fee
   the 1,000 satoshis (sats) minting fee serves multiple purposes. first, it acts as a small barrier to prevent spam or careless minting of low-quality content. second, it ensures that minters have some skin in the game, making them more invested in the success of their chosen content. finally, it contributes to the platform's treasury, funding ongoing development and operations.

   when you reach this step, your postfun extension will prompt you to approve the transaction. review the details carefully - you're authorizing the deduction of 1,000 sats from your wallet balance. make sure you have sufficient funds and understand that this fee is non-refundable.

5. once confirmed, you are the minter and the first token holder!
   after the transaction is confirmed on the lightning network, you officially become the minter of that content pool. this grants you several immediate benefits:
   - you own a portion of the initial token supply
   - you're entitled to 5% of all future trading fees in this pool
   - you're eligible for the graduation bonus if the pool succeeds
   - you gain early insights into trading activity and market sentiment

## example

let's say you see a tweet from a visionary like balaji srinivasan predicting a new trend. you believe it's going to be hugely influential. by minting it on `postfun`, you're not just agreeingâ€”you're making a verifiable, financial bet on its importance.

imagine balaji tweets something like: "we're heading into a period of unprecedented technological convergence that will reshape how we think about digital ownership by the end of next quarter." as a minter, you recognize that balaji has a track record of making accurate predictions about technology trends, and his audience includes many early adopters and investors who might find this statement compelling.

by minting this tweet, you're essentially betting that:
1. the statement will generate significant discussion and interest
2. other postfun users will see value in trading tokens representing this prediction
3. the content will maintain relevance over time as the predicted events unfold

your 1,000 sat investment could potentially grow to thousands or even millions of sats if your assessment proves correct. conversely, if the tweet fails to generate interest or the prediction doesn't resonate with the postfun community, you might lose your initial investment.

this example illustrates why minting requires both analytical skills and risk tolerance. successful minters develop frameworks for evaluating content, considering factors like:
- the creator's influence and track record
- the tweet's relevance to current events or trends
- the emotional response it's likely to generate
- its potential for ongoing relevance over time
- the existing trading activity around similar content

## advanced minter strategies

experienced minters develop sophisticated approaches to identifying profitable opportunities:

**timing considerations:** the ideal time to mint is often just as a tweet is gaining traction but before it becomes widely known within the postfun community. minting too early risks creating a market for content that never gains traction, while minting too late means missing the initial price appreciation.

**diversification:** successful minters typically spread their activity across multiple types of content rather than focusing on a single niche. this reduces risk and increases the chances of hitting a viral success.

**trend analysis:** monitoring broader cultural and technological trends helps identify tweets that might become more relevant over time. predictions about future developments often gain value as events unfold.

**community engagement:** active participation in the postfun community through discord, x.com, and other channels provides early insights into which content is generating buzz and interest.

**risk management:** setting limits on how much capital to allocate to minting activities and developing exit strategies for underperforming pools helps protect against significant losses.

the minter role in postfun represents a unique opportunity to profit from cultural insight and timing. while it requires careful analysis and carries inherent risks, successful minters can achieve substantial rewards by identifying content with long-term value potential.

# buying & selling tokens

## the trading interface

the `tradewidget` on a `post detail` page makes it easy to trade tokens. you can either enter the amount of `sats` you want to spend or the number of `tokens` you want to buy. the other value will calculate automatically. this dual-input system provides flexibility for traders with different approaches to market participation.

the trading interface is designed with both simplicity and sophistication in mind. for newcomers, it offers an intuitive way to participate in the market without needing deep technical knowledge. for experienced traders, it provides real-time data and advanced features that support complex trading strategies.

when you navigate to any content pool page, the trading widget is prominently displayed, typically in the right sidebar or below the main content. this ensures that trading opportunities are always visible and accessible without requiring additional navigation steps.

the interface displays several key pieces of information:
- current token price in sats
- 24-hour trading volume
- total liquidity in the pool
- recent price movements and trends
- your current token holdings in this pool (if any)

the automatic calculation feature works in real-time, updating values as you type. this allows you to experiment with different trade sizes and immediately see the potential outcomes. for example, you can quickly compare the impact of spending 10,000 sats versus 50,000 sats on your potential token acquisition.

## understanding price impact

because `postfun` uses a dynamic pricing curve, larger trades will move the price. the ui will show you the potential impact before you confirm. this price impact mechanism is fundamental to how postfun markets function and creates unique trading dynamics that differ significantly from traditional exchanges.

the price impact occurs because postfun uses a constant product market maker (cpmm) algorithm to determine token prices. this mathematical model ensures there's always liquidity available for trades while creating natural price movements based on supply and demand.

when you buy tokens:
- the token reserve in the pool decreases
- the virtual sats reserve increases to maintain the constant product
- this causes the price of remaining tokens to rise
- larger purchases create more significant price movements

when you sell tokens:
- the token reserve in the pool increases
- the virtual sats reserve decreases
- this causes the price of remaining tokens to fall
- larger sales create more significant price movements

the interface clearly displays the estimated price impact before you confirm any trade. this might show as a percentage change in price or as the difference between the current price and the average price you'll pay for your tokens. this transparency is crucial for informed decision-making.

several factors influence price impact:
- **trade size relative to pool liquidity:** larger trades in smaller pools create more significant impacts
- **current market conditions:** volatile markets may amplify price movements
- **recent trading activity:** pools with recent large trades may have prices that haven't fully stabilized

understanding price impact is essential for developing effective trading strategies. experienced traders learn to balance their desire for immediate execution with the cost of moving the market. some prefer to make multiple smaller trades over time to minimize impact, while others might intentionally move the market as part of a larger strategy.

## how to trade

the trading process in postfun is designed to be both secure and efficient, leveraging the nostr protocol for identity management and the lightning network for fast settlement. here's a detailed breakdown of each step:

1. click "buy" or "sell" in the trading widget
   the trading widget prominently features large, clearly labeled buttons for buying and selling. these buttons are typically color-coded (green for buy, red for sell) to provide visual cues. clicking either button opens the trading panel with additional options and information.

   before clicking, review the current market conditions displayed in the widget. this includes the current price, recent volume, and any notable price movements. this information helps inform your decision about whether to enter the market at this time.

2. enter the amount you want to trade
   you can specify your trade in either sats (for buying) or tokens (for selling). the interface automatically calculates the corresponding value, making it easy to understand exactly what you're trading.

   for buy orders, you specify how many sats you want to spend. the interface will show you approximately how many tokens you'll receive based on the current price and estimated price impact.

   for sell orders, you specify how many tokens you want to sell. the interface will show you approximately how many sats you'll receive.

   the interface also typically includes preset buttons for common trade sizes (e.g., 1,000 sats, 10,000 sats, 100,000 sats) to speed up the process for frequent traders.

3. review the details including price impact
   before confirming any trade, postfun displays a comprehensive summary of the transaction details. this review screen is crucial for preventing costly mistakes and ensuring you understand the implications of your trade.

   key information in the review includes:
   - exact number of tokens to be bought or sold
   - total sats to be spent or received
   - price per token (including average price accounting for impact)
   - estimated price impact as a percentage
   - trading fees that will be charged
   - your updated balance after the trade

   take time to carefully review all these details. once you confirm a trade, it cannot be reversed due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions.

4. approve the transaction in your extension
   security is paramount in postfun's trading system. every trade must be explicitly approved through your nostr extension, which acts as a secure signer for all transactions.

   when you click confirm, your browser extension will open a popup window displaying the transaction details. this provides a final opportunity to review and approve the trade. the extension never automatically approves transactions, ensuring that you maintain complete control over your funds.

   the approval process typically requires a simple click to confirm, though some extensions may require additional authentication steps for larger transactions or first-time trades.

5. the tokens will appear in your wallet (when buying) or sats will be added to your balance (when selling)
   once your transaction is confirmed by the lightning network, the results are immediately reflected in your wallet balance. this near-instant settlement is one of the key advantages of building on the lightning network.

   for buy orders, your token balance in that specific pool will increase, and your sats balance will decrease accordingly.

   for sell orders, your sats balance will increase, and your token balance in that pool will decrease.

   the entire process, from clicking buy/sell to seeing updated balances, typically takes just a few seconds thanks to the efficiency of the lightning network.

## advanced trading considerations

successful trading on postfun requires understanding several additional factors:

**market timing:** postfun markets can be highly volatile, with prices changing rapidly based on social media activity and external events. successful traders develop strategies for identifying optimal entry and exit points.

**liquidity management:** larger trades have more significant price impacts. experienced traders often break large orders into smaller transactions to minimize costs.

**portfolio diversification:** concentrating all funds in a single content pool creates excessive risk. successful traders spread their activity across multiple pools to reduce exposure to any single piece of content.

**fee optimization:** understanding how trading fees work and when different fee levels apply helps maximize profitability over time.

**risk management:** setting stop-losses (mental or otherwise) and position sizing rules helps protect against catastrophic losses while maintaining the ability to profit from successful trades.

the trading experience in postfun combines the excitement of social media with the discipline of financial markets, creating a unique environment where cultural insight can translate directly into financial returns.

# the pool lifecycle: from spark to supernova

## how pools evolve

each content pool on postfun goes through different levels as it gains trading volume. each level brings benefits to participants and exciting events that affect the token price. this progression system creates a structured path for content pools while providing clear milestones and rewards that encourage continued participation and investment.

the level-based progression serves multiple purposes in the postfun ecosystem:
- it creates predictable events that generate trading activity
- it rewards early participants with progressively better fee structures
- it builds anticipation and community engagement as pools approach new levels
- it ensures that the most successful content contributes more significantly to platform growth

the progression from one level to the next is entirely dependent on the pool's real trading volume, measured in satoshis that flow through the bonding curve. this creates a pure merit-based system where only the most actively traded content advances to higher levels.

as pools progress through levels, they become more attractive to different types of participants:
- early levels appeal to risk-tolerant traders seeking high potential returns
- later levels attract more conservative investors looking for established assets
- the graduation event draws attention from the entire community and external observers

the level progression also affects the economic dynamics of each pool. trading fees decrease at each level, making mature pools more cost-effective for regular trading. simultaneously, the token burn events create artificial scarcity that can drive price appreciation for remaining token holders.

## level 1: spark

the spark level represents the beginning of every content pool's journey. as the starting level for all new pools, it sets the foundation for everything that follows while establishing the initial market dynamics that will determine the pool's ultimate success.

at level 1, content pools are in their most experimental phase. they represent pure speculation on the future value of specific content, with prices driven primarily by early adopters' assessments of potential rather than proven track records.

**starting level for all new pools**
every content pool begins at level 1 immediately after minting. this creates a level playing field where all new content starts with the same basic parameters, regardless of the creator's influence or the content's initial popularity.

**trading fee is 10%**
the 10% trading fee at level 1 serves several important functions:
- it generates revenue for the platform during the experimental phase
- it acts as a natural barrier to excessive trading that might not be economically rational
- it provides substantial rewards for creators and minters who take early risks
- it helps fund the eventual token burn events through fee accumulation

this relatively high fee structure reflects the experimental nature of level 1 pools and the risks associated with early participation.

**goal: reach 1,000,000 sats in trading volume**
the first milestone requires pools to accumulate 1,000,000 sats in trading volume. this target is carefully calibrated to:
- be achievable for pools with moderate interest
- filter out content that fails to generate meaningful engagement
- provide sufficient data to assess the pool's potential for further growth

reaching this milestone represents the first major validation of a content pool's value proposition. it demonstrates that enough traders have found the content compelling enough to move significant value through the market.

the journey to 1,000,000 sats often reveals important information about a pool's prospects:
- pools that reach this milestone quickly suggest strong initial interest
- pools that struggle may indicate content with limited appeal or poor timing
- trading patterns during this phase can hint at future volatility and price movements

## level 2: bonfire

reaching level 2 marks a significant milestone in a content pool's development. at 1,000,000 sats in trading volume, the pool has demonstrated enough merit to warrant reduced fees and the first major token burn event.

**reached at 1,000,000 sats**
this milestone represents a transition from experimental to established status. pools that reach level 2 have proven they can sustain trading activity over time and have attracted enough interest to justify continued investment and development.

the move to 1,000,000 sats as a threshold reflects postfun's commitment to quality. only content pools that demonstrate genuine market interest advance to this stage, ensuring that the benefits of level 2 are reserved for pools with proven potential.

**the culling: 50,000,000 tokens are burned, increasing the price!**
the first major token burn event, known as "the culling," represents one of postfun's most innovative features. by permanently removing 50,000,000 tokens from circulation, the system creates artificial scarcity that can drive significant price appreciation.

this burn event works through the cpmm (constant product market maker) mechanism:
- with fewer tokens in circulation, each remaining token represents a larger share of the pool's value
- the reduced supply, combined with sustained or increased demand, naturally pushes prices higher
- early holders benefit from this price appreciation, rewarding their early participation

the culling event typically generates significant excitement and trading activity as participants anticipate and react to the price movements it creates. this increased activity often helps pools progress more quickly toward the next level.

**trading fee drops to 5%**
reducing fees to 5% at level 2 acknowledges the pool's transition to established status while maintaining incentives for continued platform development. this fee structure:
- makes the pool more attractive to regular traders
- reduces the cost of market making and liquidity provision
- maintains substantial rewards for creators and minters
- provides adequate revenue for platform operations

the fee reduction also reflects the decreased risk associated with level 2 pools compared to their level 1 counterparts.

**goal: reach 10,000,000 sats**
the level 2 goal of 10,000,000 sats represents a tenfold increase from the previous milestone. this ambitious target:
- filters for content pools with exceptional long-term potential
- requires sustained community interest and engagement
- justifies the significant benefits of the next level progression

reaching this milestone typically indicates that a content pool has achieved genuine cultural significance within the postfun community and potentially beyond.

## level 3: inferno

level 3 represents the elite tier of postfun content pools. reaching 10,000,000 sats in trading volume places pools in an exclusive category that attracts serious investors and generates significant attention throughout the cryptocurrency community.

**reached at 10,000,000 sats**
achieving level 3 status is a remarkable accomplishment that signifies true market validation. pools at this level have demonstrated:
- sustained interest over extended periods
- resilience through market volatility
- broad appeal across different trader segments
- cultural significance that extends beyond the postfun platform

the journey to 10,000,000 sats often spans weeks or months, requiring consistent engagement from a dedicated community of traders and investors.

**bigger event: 100,000,000 more tokens are burned!**
the level 3 token burn event doubles the previous burn in absolute terms, removing 100,000,000 tokens from circulation. this massive burn creates even more dramatic price movements and generates intense excitement throughout the postfun community.

the combined effect of multiple burn events becomes increasingly powerful:
- tokens that survived the level 2 culling become even more valuable
- the reduced supply creates stronger price support
- remaining holders benefit from accelerated appreciation potential
- the event attracts attention from traders who may have missed earlier opportunities

this burn event often coincides with peak trading activity as participants attempt to capitalize on the anticipated price movements.

**trading fee drops to 3%**
the reduction to 3% trading fees at level 3 reflects the premium status of these elite pools. this fee structure:
- positions level 3 pools as among the most cost-effective trading venues on postfun
- attracts high-volume traders and market makers
- maintains meaningful rewards for creators and minters
- supports the platform's ongoing development with substantial revenue

the low fee environment at level 3 makes these pools attractive for sophisticated trading strategies that might be unprofitable at higher fee levels.

**goal: reach 100,000,000 sats (1 btc)**
the final milestone of 100,000,000 sats (1 btc) represents the ultimate achievement for any postfun content pool. reaching this goal:
- places the pool in truly exclusive company
- triggers the most significant events in the postfun ecosystem
- demonstrates unprecedented cultural and financial significance
- creates lasting value that extends beyond the platform

achieving graduation status requires extraordinary community commitment and represents one of the most difficult accomplishments in the entire postfun system.

## level 4: graduation

the endgame! reached at 1 btc in trading volume. graduation represents the pinnacle of achievement for any content pool and triggers the most significant events in the postfun ecosystem.

graduation is more than just another level progression - it represents the transformation of a content pool from an experimental social finance instrument into a permanent fixture of the decentralized financial landscape. pools that reach this status have achieved genuine cultural and financial significance that extends far beyond the postfun platform.

**the supernova**
a final, massive burn of 150,000,000 tokens. the supernova event represents the culmination of postfun's token burn philosophy, removing the largest single batch of tokens from circulation in a dramatic finale that often generates extreme price volatility and intense trading activity.

the supernova burn serves multiple purposes:
- it creates maximum price appreciation for remaining token holders
- it generates significant attention from the broader cryptocurrency community
- it provides a memorable conclusion to the pool's progression journey
- it ensures that the final distribution represents true market value

the timing and impact of the supernova event often become topics of intense discussion and speculation within the postfun community, with traders developing complex strategies to maximize their returns during this critical period.

**the payout**
the 1 btc is distributed as follows:
- platform treasury: 40%
- minter: 10%
- creator: 5%
- remaining 45%: used to create a permanent, publicly tradable market

this distribution reflects postfun's commitment to balanced incentives across all participant types:
- the platform receives substantial rewards for facilitating the pool's success
- the minter is rewarded for their early vision and risk-taking
- the creator benefits from the long-term cultural significance of their content
- the remaining tokens ensure continued market liquidity and accessibility

the 40% platform treasury allocation is particularly significant, as it funds ongoing development, security improvements, and community initiatives that benefit the entire postfun ecosystem.

**the dex listing**
the remaining 45% of the btc and all remaining tokens are used to create a permanent, publicly tradable market on a decentralized exchange. this represents the final evolution of successful content pools from experimental social finance instruments to established assets in the broader decentralized finance ecosystem.

the dex listing provides several important benefits:
- it ensures continued liquidity and price discovery beyond postfun
- it allows the pool to participate in broader cryptocurrency market movements
- it creates a permanent record of the content's cultural and financial significance
- it provides an additional trading venue for interested participants

the transition to a decentralized exchange also represents a shift from postfun's curated environment to the completely open markets of decentralized finance, where the pool must compete directly with thousands of other assets for trader attention and liquidity.

this final stage ensures that the most successful content pools achieve lasting significance that extends far beyond their initial social media origins, creating permanent financial instruments that capture and preserve cultural moments of genuine importance.
